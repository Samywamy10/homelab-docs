# Sam's Homelab Docs

[![GitHub deployments](https://img.shields.io/github/deployments/samywamy10/homelab-docs/github-pages?logo=github&label=Deploy)](https://samywamy10.github.io/homelab-docs)

A site built with Docusaurus and hosted on Github Pages with Cloudflare. I kept running into niche situations with my Homelab and other tech things at home that I wanted to document. 

Not really expecting anyone to view this site but if you have any suggestions or improvements I'm open to PRs ðŸ˜Š.
